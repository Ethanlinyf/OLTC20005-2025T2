## Activity 1
In my role as an ICT lecturer and working in the field of network and cybersecurity, adult learning is essential because the field changes rapidly and industry expectations shift constantly. Many of my students are adult learners on different campuses returning to study to up skill, change careers, or gain certification alongside work and family commitments. Adult learning principles help me design teaching that is practical, flexible, and clearly connected to real workplace tasks—such as configuring secure networks, responding to incidents, or applying risk controls. As a discipline lead, adult learning is also valuable for staff development: it supports consistent teaching standards, encourages reflective practice, and helps the team stay current with emerging threats, tools, and compliance requirements. When adult learning is embedded well, it strengthens student engagement, improves job readiness, and builds a culture of continuous improvement across the discipline.

## Activity 2
Anthony Jack raises a couple of issues that I really relate to in my teaching. One is that getting students in the door isn’t the same as helping them feel included. A lot of students don’t automatically know the “unwritten rules” of study—how to use feedback, what tutors expect, when to ask for help, or even what “good academic work” looks like. That gap can hit harder for first-in-family students or people returning to study later in life, which links to what we see in learner diversity across classes. 

The second issue is how universities can accidentally reward the students who already know the system, and leave others playing catch-up. In my ICT networking/cybersecurity classes, I see this when some students confidently join study groups and ask questions early, while others stay quiet until assessment time. What I want to change is making expectations more obvious (samples, checklists, short “how to succeed” guides), building low-pressure peer support, and checking in early so students don’t fall behind.

## Activity 3

Respecting First Nations protocols and language matters because words carry power: they can either recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as distinct, living cultures with continuing connection to Country, or they can unintentionally erase, stereotype, or “other” them. Using correct, capitalised terms (e.g., Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Country) and avoiding outdated labels or acronyms helps communicate respect and accuracy, especially in higher education where students take cues from the language we normalise. AIATSIS notes that “Indigenous” can feel overly generic for some people and emphasises respectful naming and capitalisation. The Australian Government Style Manual also stresses using “Indigenous” carefully and clearly when writing generally, rather than as a vague catch-all.

In my educator role, I can manage this by explicitly teaching and modelling preferred terminology, embedding a short language glossary in assessment instructions, and checking local preferences when content relates to specific Nations or communities. I’ll also open classes and events with an Acknowledgement of Country (and only arrange a Welcome to Country through Traditional Owners), reinforcing why these practices matter in professional settings. Finally, I will use strengths-based, non-deficit language and correct issues promptly and respectfully when they arise in student discussions.

Some practices we already have are listed below: 
1. At the begining of first lecture online Zoom class, we acknowledge the country withe "The School of Engineering and Technology respectfully acknowledges the traditional owners of the lands on which we teach, learn, research, and undertake service and engagement. We pay our respects to the First Nations People and their elders past, present and future."
2. To integrated the Indigenous knowledge in a networking unit: "In this multi-cultural society, we would like to emphasise the traditional or local knowledge and acknowledge the country. As the quote "While exploring difference, never lose sight of sameness for it is the sameness that brings us together. – by John Briggs" indicates, communication networks also make us get together to learn the knowledge of network Infrastructure in this Unit. "
3. Extra slides to introduce the Indigenisation of ICT Curriculum. See more details in the unit COIT11238 Networked Infrastructure Foundations (HT1, 2025)

## Activity 4 
Inclusion breaks inclusion down into three simple areas based on the provided paper:

**Creating inclusive cultures** – This is the “vibe” of the place. Do people feel they belong? Are differences (culture, ability, language, identity) seen as normal and valuable? It’s about building a community where respect and teamwork are the default. 

**Producing inclusive policies** – These are the “rules of the game.” Policies should actively remove barriers, not quietly create them. That includes enrolment, behaviour, assessment, support services, and how decisions get made so everyone gets fair access. 

**Evolving inclusive practices** – This is what happens day-to-day in classrooms. Teaching, activities, and assessment are adjusted so all learners can participate and succeed, not just the “standard” student. It’s inclusion in action.

| **Similarities**                                             | Both view learning as **active** and built through engagement, not passive reception of content. Learners develop understanding through **doing**, exploring, and reflecting.                                                                                                              | Same: learning is **learner-centred**, active, and strengthened by interaction (with tasks, people, or tools) rather than only listening/reading.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Differences**                                              | Emphasises learners **constructing meaning from experience** (hands-on tasks, problem-based learning). Knowledge develops through **reflection** and scaffolding in a learning environment.                                                                                                | Emphasises learning through **networks** (people, digital platforms, communities, tools). Highlights “**knowing where to find**” and updating knowledge in rapidly changing fields.                                                                                                                                          |
| **How could use it in my teaching / past experiences** | Use **authentic lab scenarios** in networking/cybersecurity: troubleshooting misconfigurations, building secure network designs, incident response simulations, or analysing logs. Students learn through **trial, error, and reflection** (e.g., explaining why a control worked/failed). | Build **connected learning** by using live industry sources: CVE databases, vendor advisories, threat intel feeds, GitHub tools, professional forums, and communities. Activities can include **weekly threat briefings**, source evaluation tasks, collaborative resource curation, and sharing solutions in peer networks. |


## Activity 6
In my networking and cybersecurity classes, I use experiential learning by getting students to do real tasks first—like troubleshooting a broken network, analysing a packet capture, or responding to a fake security alert. After that, we pause and reflect: what did you notice, what worked, what didn’t, and why? Then we link it to the theory (routing, DNS, MITRE, least privilege) and try again with a new twist. With constructionism, students learn by building stuff: a secure network design, a small lab, firewall rules, or a simple SIEM dashboard—then they explain and defend their choices.

| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1) Self-concept**                     | Learners rely on the teacher to set goals, choose content, and direct learning (“Do this because I said so / it’s on the test”). | Learners want control and choice. They prefer to plan learning with us as educators, have options, and take responsibility for progress.                             |
| **2) Experience**                       | Learners have limited experience to draw on, so teaching often starts from scratch and uses examples chosen by the teacher.      | Learners bring lots of work/life experience. Teaching taps into what they already know, uses peer sharing, and treats experience as a learning resource. |
| **3) Readiness to learn**               | Readiness is linked to age/grade level and external requirements (move to the next unit/year; pass assessments).                 | Readiness is linked to real-life needs and role demands (new job tasks, workplace problems, “I need this now”).                                          |
| **4) Orientation to learning**          | Subject-centred: learn topics in a sequence (content first, application later).                                                  | Problem-centred: learn through solving authentic tasks (application first, theory when needed).                                                          |
| **5) Motivation**                       | Motivation is often external (grades, rewards, parent/teacher approval, avoiding failure).                                       | Motivation is mostly internal (career growth, confidence, job satisfaction, quality of life, personal goals).                                            |

## Activity 8
Mezirow’s transformative learning explains how adults don’t just gain new info—they can actually change how they think. His big contribution is the idea that learning can shift a person’s “frame of reference” when they question assumptions and rethink beliefs after a challenging experience.

 In **networking** and **cybersecurity**, this fits well with ethics, risk thinking, and real breach case studies that push students past “tool-only” thinking and into deeper judgement and responsibility.

Gardner’s multiple intelligences challenges the idea that learners have one standard way of being “smart.” His contribution is recognising different strengths and ways of processing, so teaching should offer varied entry points and assessments.

 In my classes, I can mix diagrams, labs, simulations, short videos, and written incident reports, and let students demonstrate the same outcomes in different formats.

Wenger’s social learning (communities of practice) argues learning is mainly social—people learn by participating in shared practice, not just absorbing content.

 This fits perfectly with cyber teamwork: run “SOC-style” group tasks, rotating roles, shared tools, peer review, and debriefs so students learn the culture and habits of real professionals.

 ## Activity 9 
 After reading both articles, my feeling on new was realising how social learning is at a brain level. I always knew relationships matter in teaching, but I didn’t fully get that the brain actually learns better when it feels safe, connected, and supported. The Berkeley article made it clear that humans are wired to learn through other humans, and that a positive teacher–student relationship can change how well students focus, cope with stress, and take risks with learning.

From the neuroplasticity reading, what I didn’t really know is that learning is basically the brain rewiring itself through experience—and that this rewiring is influenced by emotion, movement, and interaction, not just “thinking hard.” The idea that the brain has priorities (like body/senses first, then emotions, then social stuff, then deep thinking) was interesting too. It explains why students shut down when they’re anxious or overwhelmed: their brain is busy protecting them, not analysing content.

In my networking and cybersecurity classes, this pushes me to build more supportive group problem-solving (like troubleshooting labs in pairs) and create a low-shame vibe where mistakes are normal, because that’s where real learning and brain growth happens.

## Activity 10
![alt text](image.png)

My VARK results show I’m a multimodal learner, so I naturally teach in mixed ways too. In networking and cybersecurity, this fits well because students need diagrams (topologies, threat models), explanations and discussion (troubleshooting thinking), written steps (lab guides, checklists), and hands-on practice (configs, Wireshark, SIEM queries). I don’t think I need a big change, but I do need to be more intentional. I should make sure lessons aren’t built only around how I learn, but include options for students who prefer quieter reflection or more structure.

## Activity 11
![alt text](image-1.png)

With Pragmatist (13) and Theorist (10), my teaching style naturally goes: explain the “why” clearly, then show how it works in the real world. That suits networking and cybersecurity because students want skills they can actually use on the job. I probably lean on structured content, models, and step-by-step problem solving more than “jump in and wing it.”

But my Activist score (3) is a reminder I might need to add more quick, hands-on moments—like timed troubleshooting, mini CTF challenges, or role-play incident response—so students practise making decisions under pressure.

I don’t think I need a total change, just a better balance to meet different learner needs.
